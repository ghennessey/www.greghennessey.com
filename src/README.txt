1. When I run 'npm run build' it creates a series of files here in the build folder
2. I want to include these files in my WordPress theme site, so next move them into the theme folder.
-- In this case, the theme folder is "gh-2018"
3. The theme is powered by an index.php, so I need to copy the index.html content generated by my build into the index.php file
4. Then I can upload this theme into my site and I should be able to pull the WordPress json into my react app from there
5. I found and am using the wpapi npm package https://www.npmjs.com/package/wpapi which should let me access wp rest api functions <- Decided not to use this and just use regular fetch from JS
6. The 'static' folder needs to be uploaded to the base www.greghennessey.com directory, not the wp-content/themes/gh-2018 directory
